    <p>Summer is here and that means it’s potluck season. Bring on the backyard barbecues, the rooftop soirees and the outdoor dinners.<br> Whenever I’m invited to these events I always want to bring that one dish that wows the other guests. <br>You want to hear people whispering, “What’s in this? Who made it? How do I get the recipe?” while they shove another forkful in their mouths.</p><br>
    <p>Pasta salad is always a good choice to bring to these types of parties: It can be made ahead of time and tastes better the longer it sits. But there’s one problem ― it can be boring and flavorless.</p><br>
    <p>But good news: Making a stellar pasta salad only takes one simple ingredient you probably already have in the back of your fridge … pickle juice!</p><br>
    <p>Using the <u>leftover brine</u> from a jar of pickles isn’t a new phenomenon: It’s been used to marinate chicken, <u>cure hangovers</u>, add a zing to bloody marys<br> and even <u>relieve cramps</u> in athletes. The juice and spices at the bottom of the jar are a delicious combination of vinegar, garlic, dill, mustard seeds, <br>peppercorns and coriander seeds. It adds a brightness to dishes with a pop of acidity, sourness and tang. Think of it as a one-stop shop for flavor.</p><br>
    <p>In this recipe, the pickle juice cuts the richness of the mayo in a dill-heavy ranch dressing while adding a briny punch of flavor. The pasta salad also includes perfectly al dente noodles, <br>a good measure of diced pickles, hunks of sharp cheddar cheese, fresh summer tomatoes and of course extra crispy thick-cut bacon. <br>It’s basically all of your favorite foods combined into one dish and conveniently called a “salad.”</p><br>
    <p>The next time you’re looking to be the culinary superstar of the summer,<br> look no further than a jar of pickles. The results will surprise you and your friends.</p>
